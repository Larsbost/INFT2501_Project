You need to have Flutter installed on you computer.
For Windows use: 
```
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
```
If you're using another OS, or want to dwonload the .zip you can find it [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

You may also need to add Flutter to your environment path.
  After that just boot up an Android emulator and run main.dart.
